                <p>Hi, my name is Ali Mejbel, and I am 21 years old. I was born and raised in Canada, and I graduated from Sir Frederick Banting alternative high school. My favourite hobby is running because it's challenging and rewarding. I also enjoy spending time with my friends and family because they have similar interests and hobbies and make it always fun to go out with. I would love to join the web developer program provided by the Xtreme Talent Accelerator Program because web development is my dream job. I would love to advance in a career in web development because I can increase my programming skills every day, and it is a changeling and rewarding career. The web developer program provided by Xtreme Talent Accelerator is everything to me. If I get accepted, it will benefit me in the future because I can advance my career and prove myself that I can become a web developer. It is important to plan and know who you are and what you want in the future.
